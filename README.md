# iPort — iPod for the web

A faithful iPod simulator that runs in your browser. Pick a model, load your own
music (or stream from YouTube, SoundCloud and free sources), spin it around in
3D, and design your own colorway.

## Features

### EarPods that plug in

Press play and an EarPods cable rises from the bottom of the window and clicks
into the headphone jack. The cable is a physics simulation: it sags, swings when
you turn the iPod, and you can grab it. Pull the plug out and the music pauses,
just like a real iPod.

### Real 3D

Drag the background to spin the iPod, scroll to zoom, or use Front, Back, Side
and 360° at the bottom of the page.

### Make it yours

Every colored part, the materials, wallpapers, screen theme, engraving on the
back and the backdrop. Save a design as a preset, share it as a link, or export
all your presets to a file.

### Your music, from anywhere

- **Your own files:** MP3, AAC/M4A, FLAC, WAV, OGG and video. Tags and album art
  are read in the browser and kept in IndexedDB; nothing is uploaded. Drag files
  anywhere onto the page.
- **YouTube and SoundCloud:** paste a link or search, played through their
  official embedded players.
- **Free sources:** Audius, the Internet Archive, internet radio
  (radio-browser.info), podcasts, 30-second iTunes previews and direct links.

### Everything else

- One shared player: switching models keeps the music playing, and the queue and
  position are remembered between visits.
- Equalizer with all iPod presets, Sound Check, synced lyrics, sleep timer,
  alarms, and keyboard / lock-screen media keys.
- Works on phones and installs as a web app.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173  (?model=classic|touch7|nano7|shuffle4)
npm run build      # type-check + production build into dist/
npm test           # unit tests
```

Requires Node 20.19+ or 22.12+. `npm run dev` also serves the functions in `api/`
(YouTube search, podcast feed proxy and so on), so every source works locally.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the code is organised.

## Versioning

iPort follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (2.0.0): something users relied on changes or goes away.
- **MINOR** (1.1.0): new features that keep everything working.
- **PATCH** (1.0.1): bug fixes and polish.

The app shows its version and build in the Help panel (?) and in the logo's tooltip.

To release:

1. Move the notes under **Unreleased** in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) to a new
   version heading and commit.
2. Run `npm run release:patch`, `npm run release:minor` or `npm run release:major`.
   This bumps `package.json`, commits "Release vX.Y.Z" and creates the `vX.Y.Z` tag.
3. Push the commit and the tag: `git push && git push --tags`.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Go to <https://vercel.com/new>, choose **Import Git Repository**, and pick this repo.
3. Vercel detects **Vite** automatically (`vercel.json` sets build command `npm run build` and output `dist`). Click **Deploy**.
4. Every push to the default branch redeploys; pull requests get preview URLs.

No environment variables or API keys are needed.

### วิธี deploy ขึ้น Vercel (ภาษาไทย)

1. เข้า <https://vercel.com/new> แล้วล็อกอินด้วย GitHub
2. กด **Import** ที่ repo นี้
3. Vercel จะตรวจเจอว่าเป็นโปรเจกต์ **Vite** เอง (ตั้งค่าไว้ใน `vercel.json` แล้ว) กด **Deploy** ได้เลย
4. หลังจากนั้นทุกครั้งที่ push โค้ดขึ้น branch หลัก Vercel จะ deploy ใหม่ให้อัตโนมัติ — ไม่ต้องตั้งค่า API key ใด ๆ
